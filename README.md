# AstroView

> Spatial dataviz to protect the planet.  
> Our planetâ€¦ and a massive asteroid on a collision course. What would be the consequences of such an impact? Understanding these effects requires a tool that turns complex physics into accessible simulations. Thatâ€™s why we created AstroView â€” powered by *ASTRO AI (Planetary Security Artificial Intelligence)*.

## ðŸŒŽ About the project

AstroView is a platform for visualizing and simulating asteroid risk.  
It turns open data into interactive simulations to help understand, communicate, and mitigate potential impacts on Earth â€” from public engagement to decision support.

---

## âœ¨ Key features

- Accessible simulations: complex physics converted into interactive experiences.
- Geospatial dataviz: trajectories, impact zones, and secondary effects.
- ASTRO AI: estimates and risk insights in near real time.
- Integrated analysis: orbital, topographic, and atmospheric variables to predict impact point, *shock waves, **tremors, and *tsunamis.
- Usage profiles (personalized UX): Enthusiast, Student, Researcher/Scientist, and Civil Defense/Managers.

## ðŸ§° Stack

- Frontend: React + *TypeScript* + HTML + Tailwind CSS
- State/Query: e.g., React Query/Zustand/Context API
- Build: Vite or Next.js (adjust to your setup)
- Tests: Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library (optional)
